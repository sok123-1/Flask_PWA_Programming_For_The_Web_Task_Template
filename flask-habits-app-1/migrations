This directory contains migration scripts for managing database schema changes in the Flask Habits App.

To create and apply migrations, you can use Flask-Migrate, which is built on top of Alembic. 

To initialize the migrations directory, run the following command in your terminal:

    flask db init

To create a new migration after making changes to your models, run:

    flask db migrate -m "Your migration message"

To apply the migration to the database, run:

    flask db upgrade
